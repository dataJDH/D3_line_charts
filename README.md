# line_charts
Visualize earthquake statistics in four different ways

Four plots, which are placed one after the other on a single HTML page.

1. Creating line chart. Create a line chart that visualizes the number of earthquakes worldwide from 2000 to 2015 (inclusively), for the four magnitude ranges: ['5_5.9', '6_6.9', '7_7.9', '8.0+']. Add a legend at the top right corner of the chart showing the magnitude-color mapping.

2. Adding symbols and scaling symbol sizes. Create a line chart for this part (whose design is a variant of what you have created in part a. Visualize each data point in the chart as a solid circle, whose size is proportional to “Estimated Deaths”. 

3. Create two line charts for this part. Modify the vertical axis scale for each chart: the first chart uses the square root scale for its vertical axis (only), and the second plot uses the log scale for its vertical axis (only).
